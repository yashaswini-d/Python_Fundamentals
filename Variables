Creating Variables:
    Variables are containers for storing data values.Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    A variable is created when you assign a value to it.
Creating Variable name:    
    A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    A variable name cannot start with a number
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    
#Legal variable names:
  myvar = "yashu"
  my_var = "yashu"
  _my_var = "yashu"
  myVar = "yashu"
  MYVAR = "yashu"
  myvar2 = "yashu"

#Illegal variable names:
  2myvar = "yashu"
  my-var = "yashu"
  my var = "yashu"
  
**ASSIGN VALUE TO MULTIPLE VARIABLES**
    Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
  1) x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
  2) x = y = z = "Orange"
  
**OUTPUT VARIABLES**
